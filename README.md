## TODOS
- [ ] allow user to delete/modify their recipes
- [ ] what about desert?
- [ ] more testing
- [ ] handle redux error states

## Possible features
- More information about each recipe: servings, prep time, etc.
- image cropping
- search by username
- ability to 'cross out' ingredients

## Notes
Security is minimal; users log in with just a unique user name - no password.  The name is obscured from other users.
The risk to a users account is a tradeoff in order to keep from overly complicating things given the less than critical nature of the data (...and I hate passwords  ðŸ˜¡).
